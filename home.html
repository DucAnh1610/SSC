             <h3>The colleges and halls</h3> 
            <p>The 36 colleges and three societies are a core element of the University, to which they are related via a federal system.</p>
            <p>Each college is independent and self-governing, having a charter approved by the Privy Council, under which it is governed by a Head of House, elected and appointed by the governing body directly. The governing body comprises a number of Fellows, most of whom also hold University posts.</p>
            <p>The three societies – Kellogg College, Reuben College and St Cross College – operate very much like the other colleges but are considered departments of the University rather than independent colleges because, unlike the others, they do not have a royal charter. One of the main differences is that the governing body recommends a president, who is then appointed by Council.</p>
            <p>There are also five permanent private halls, which were founded by different Christian denominations, and still retain their religious character today.
                Undergraduates are admitted to 32 of the colleges and permanent private halls. All colleges accept applications from mature students, while Harris Manchester College is solely for mature students.</p>
            <p>Campion Hall and Green Templeton, Kellogg, Linacre, Nuffield, Reuben, St Antony’s, St Cross and Wolfson Colleges admit only postgraduate students. All Souls is unique among Oxford colleges because it has no student members; all are Fellows, except the Warden.</p>
            <h3>The role of the colleges and halls and the University in student life</h3>
            <p>Colleges, societies and halls: <br>
                Select and admit undergraduate students, and select postgraduate students after they are admitted by the University <br>
                Provide accommodation, meals, common rooms, libraries, sports and social facilities, and pastoral care for their students <br>
                Are responsible for students’ undergraduate tutorial teaching and welfare</p>

                        The United Nations’ High Level Expert Group (HLEG) has today issued a tough report aimed at preventing net zero being undermined by false claims and ‘greenwashing’ and encouraging climate action, while new data from Oxford’s Net Zero Tracker shows most net zero promises made by companies, cities and regions are not on track.

                        Researchers, led by the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, have developed a new tool for doctors to identify patients at high risk of serious falls. The tool could have a big impact on the way older patients are managed in primary care, improving targeting of drug treatment and fall prevention strategies for high-risk individuals.

                        What do you picture when you think of academic research? You might imagine an academic sifting through a pile of hefty books in a university library, looking for the evidence they need to unlock their argument. The shift towards digital content means this picture is changing.
